# GameTestLib
### W.I.P. GameTest system, originally made for PistonLib

## TODO
- Documentation
- All block textures
- Client-side block renderers (showing the block it checks, etc...)
- Proper combination logic
- Block for testing entities (with renderers)

## Features
- Able to join the test server
- Can disable the tick warping (config w.i.p.)
- Multiple blocks for code-less testing
- Config bindings and annotations to create batches that toggle config options
- Sweet UI's to make everything easier
- Fixed a couple gametest bugs

# GameTestLib
### W.I.P. GameTest system, originally made for PistonLib

## TODO
- Documentation
- Add missing textures to all blocks
- Proper combination logic
- Add a test mod to test GameTestLib (testception)
- Add colored borders around batches on the ground (possibly around inner batches also)
- Make structures save directly into your dev resources directory (loading works)
- Make sure structures are only loaded from dev resources (to prevent loading old structure versions)
- Testing Blocks for Shape & Block updates
- POI testing blocks

## Known Bugs
- Generated resources don't seem to be getting loaded from the mod

## Features
- Able to join the test server
- Can disable the tick warping (config w.i.p.)
- Multiple blocks for code-less testing
- Config bindings and annotations to create batches that toggle config options
- Sweet UI's to make everything easier
- Fixed a couple gametest bugs
